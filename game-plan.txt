Simulator Game to give Lobotomies

Progression
Stage 1:
Start with small lobotomy business and basic equipment
Satisfy customers to earn Brain Cells ($)
Give yourself lobotomies, which will make giving lobotomies harder, increasing risk and reward

Stage 2:
Expand your lobotomy business and buy new equipment
Begin hiring employees and lobotomize them to upgrade them
Receive contracts to lobotomize random people requested by clients (totally safe and not life-altering)

Stage 3:
Receive search & seizure warrant from authorities
Get business shut down for "illegal activities" (This acts as prestige and only activates after accepting a risky contract)

Prestige
After restarting the business in a new country, earn more brain cells per lobotomy and have access to more advanced equipment and employees

Country Progression: Mexico, United States, Russia, China, India, Egypt, Japan
Once all countries have been completed, create an empire of lobotomy-giving centers throughout several countries
